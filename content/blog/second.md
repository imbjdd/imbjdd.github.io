Most hackathons are AI focused. Some of them are crypto focused. But they are mostly tech focused.
They often do not have a particular vision or objective. With [Simon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-nordmann-389453108/) and [Alice](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-pjie-7b94a1236/), we tried to do it differently.
What if projects made during hackathons could be really impactful?

Hack the Fork was organized in this context.
Around 100 hackers from the best European schools participated. The theme of the hackathon was: [How can we improve foodtech using AI?](https://hackthefork.notion.site/25fe1f404b2180a5ba54e6aa1cbe80c4?v=25fe1f404b21809b9e1a000c62f05774)
